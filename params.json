That includes snow, RMPI, foreach, parallel, multicore, PVM, nws and others [see survey of R parallelism] (http://pubs.sciepub.com/ajams/2/4/9/). Speed can in such a scale directly with the number of CPU cores or threads.\r\n\r\n### Native Parallelism\r\nNatively the R engine itself can utilize parallelism, as for example the freely available [Revolution Analytics R] (http://www.revolutionanalytics.com/). \r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nTobias Kind (2015)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
